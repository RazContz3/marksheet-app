# Student Categorization Analysis (Sri Lankan Term Test)

## 1. Passing Criteria (Sri Lanka)
- At least 6 passes (A, B, C, S) including Sinhala and Mathematics.
- Out of those, at least 3 credits (A, B, or C).

### Alternative Pass Criteria
- Pass for Sinhala or Mathematics.
- At least 5 passes (A, B, C, S).
- At least 3 credits (A, B, or C).

## 2. Minimum Marks Considered
- **Pass mark threshold:** 35
- **May Be Pass threshold:** 20
- **Credits (A/B/C):** Only if marks ≥ 35

## 3. Excel File Logic (s1_neg.xlsm)
- Column CE (83rd column) formula:
  - If CC (A/B/C/S/W count) ≥ 6 and CD (A/B/C count) ≥ 3 and key subjects ≥ 35 → "6/3 සමත්" (Pass)
  - If CC ≥ 5 and CD ≥ 3 and key subjects ≥ 35 → "5/3 සමත්" (Pass)
  - If CC ≥ 4 and CD ≥ 1 and key subjects ≥ 20 → "සමත් කළ හැකි" (May Be Pass)
  - If W count = 9 → "W9" (Withdrawn)
  - Else → "අසමත් ?" (Fail)
- **Note:** The file incorrectly counts "W" as a pass. Correct logic should exclude "W" from pass calculations.

## 4. How Students Are Categorized
- **Pass (6/3 or 5/3):** Meets main/alternative criteria.
- **May Be Pass:** Close to passing, missing one or more requirements (e.g., just below 35 in one subject).
- **Withdrawn:** 9 "W" grades.
- **Fail:** Does not meet any criteria above.

## 5. Filtering for Special Attention
- Students marked as "May Be Pass" are close to passing and may need extra help (e.g., just one subject short).
- You can further filter by checking which subject(s) they missed, or how close their marks are to the pass threshold.

## 6. Sinhala Summary
- "සමත් කළ හැකි" – ප්‍රධාන පසුගිය විභාගය සඳහා අවශ්‍ය සුදුසුකම් නොමැති නමුත් සමත් විය හැකි සිසුන්.
- "W9" – විභාගයෙන් ඉවත් වූ සිසුන්.
- "අසමත් ?" – සමත් වීමට අවශ්‍ය සුදුසුකම් නොමැති, විශේෂ අවධානය අවශ්‍ය සිසුන්.

## 7. Recommendations for App
- Exclude "W" from pass calculations.
- Use only "A", "B", "C", "S" for pass and "A", "B", "C" for credits.
- Ensure Sinhala and Mathematics are included in pass subjects.
- Flag students who are close to passing (e.g., missing by one subject or a few marks) for special attention.

## 8. Example Algorithm (Pseudocode)
```
for each student:
    count_passes = count of (A/B/C/S) grades
    count_credits = count of (A/B/C) grades
    sinhala_pass = grade in Sinhala is A/B/C/S and marks >= 35
    math_pass = grade in Mathematics is A/B/C/S and marks >= 35
    if count_passes >= 6 and count_credits >= 3 and sinhala_pass and math_pass:
        category = "Pass"
    elif (sinhala_pass or math_pass) and count_passes >= 5 and count_credits >= 3:
        category = "Pass"
    elif count_passes >= 4 and count_credits >= 1 and (Sinhala or Math marks >= 20):
        category = "May Be Pass"
    elif W_count == 9:
        category = "Withdrawn"
    else:
        category = "Fail"
```
